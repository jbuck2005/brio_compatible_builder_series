<h1><b>Gears</b></h1>

Gears are involute gears that have been designed to be dimensionally compatible with the Brio builder toy set.<br>
Gears can be broken down into the following categories:
<ol>
  <li>idler - 10mm hole at the center</li><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/gears/idler.png">
  <li>cross axle - cross-shaped drive axle center</li><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/gears/cross_axle.png">
</ol><br>
Within the main categories, gears can be futher sub-dividied into the following:
<ol>
  <li><a href=#single>single</a></li>
  <li><a href=#double>double</a></li>
</ol>
<b><h3>single</h3></b><br><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/gears/gear_single_cross_25.png">
Single gears are single thickness gears that offer different gear ratios to be developed.<br>
<br>Naming convention: single thickness gears are named for their center profile type (idler vs cross axle) and then their tooth count (in multiples of 5). The image above would be single_cross_25 gear<br>
<b><br><code>diameter = <a href="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/brio_builder_set-dimensions.csv">bolt head thickness + nut thickness + (bolt diameter / 4) + (bolt length multiplier x beam thickness)</a></code></b><br>
<br>
<b><h3>double</h3></b><br><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/gears/gear_double_idler_10_25.png">
Double gears are stacked gears that offer different gear ratios to be developed.<br>
<br>Naming convention: double gears are named for their central profile type first and then their tooth counts, starting with the smaller count first. If you needed an idler gear (hole at the center) with two different tooth counts, say 10 and 25, you would select the double_idler_10_25 gear. If perhaps you wanted a cross-axle profile at the center and a tooth count of 15 and 20, you would select the double_cross_15_20 gear. The image above would be double_idler_10_25 gear<br>
<br><code>nut stop bolt length = regular bolt length + <a href="<a href="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/brio_builder_set-dimensions.csv">(nut stop length x nut stop multiplier)</a></code><br>
