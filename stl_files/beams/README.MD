<h1><b>Beams</b></h1>
Beams are structural building blocks that are dimensionally compatible with the Brio builder toy set.<br>
Beams can be broken down into the following categories:
<ol>
  <li>normal</li>
  <li>slotted</li>
</ol><br>

<b><h3>normal</h3></b><br><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/beams/normal_4.png">
Normal beams have holes running the entire length of the shape. Hole (10mm diameter) spacing is 16mm which is half of the spacing found on other parts, which accomodates a greater variety of shapes.<br>
<br>Naming convention: if you require a beam with 4 holes, you would use a normal_4 beam. If instead you need a beam with 8 holes, you would use a normal_8 beam. The image above would be normal_4<br>
<b><br><code>normal beam length = <a href="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/brio_builder_set-dimensions.csv">(# holes - 1) x 16mm + 30mm</a></code></b><br>
<br>
<b><h3>slotted</h3></b><br><img src="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/stl_files/beams/slotted_4.png">
Slotted beams are unique in that they do not have holes that run along the length at discrete intervals, instead the entire inner profile is available for mounting objects. Slotted beams allow for a much greater control over build shapes due to the variations afforded.<br>
<br>Naming convention: slotted beams are named after their normal counterparts. If you need a slotted beam with the equivalent length of a 4 hole normal beam, you would use slotted_4 beam. If instead you need a slotted beam with 8 hole equivalents, you would use a slotted_8 beam. The image above would be slotted_4<br>
<br><code>slotted beam length = <a href="https://github.com/jbuck2005/brio_compatible_builder_series/blob/master/brio_builder_set-dimensions.csv">(# holes - 1) x 16mm + 30mm</a></code><br>
<br><b>slotted beams start at 4 hole equivalents due to the geometry of the slotted design</b>
